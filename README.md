[AI In Cybersecurity: Revolutionizing Safety](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/15/ai-in-cybersecurity-revolutionizing-safety/)

AI significantly reshapes our daily lives. It offers convenience and safety but also inspires new cyber threats. AI's capability to generate lifelike content complicates distinguishing between what's real and what's artificial. This can be exploited by malicious individuals to create false scenarios. I have heard about this exploit over social media, people faking kidnappings for ransom. This article is interesting because it delves into these pressing issues. It explores the challenges and solutions related to AI's dual role, including the adoption of proactive, adaptive cybersecurity measures that use AI to quickly identify and address threats in real time. It also emphasizes the importance of building security and privacy into AI from the start.


Comment: I think the issue of distinguishing real and fake is interesting. AI will only create more and more lifelike pictures, which will lead to malicious impersonation. I hope AI can be incorporated to better differentiate between real and fake.
