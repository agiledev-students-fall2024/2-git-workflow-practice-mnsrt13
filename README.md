This article breaks the news that Instagram will create **"teen accounts"** for all new and existing users under 18 years old. The new accounts include more parental control than ever, with parents now able to see who their teen chats with and how they react to their friends' stories and messages. Instagram will also include new features to more accurately verify the users' age to avoid teens lying about it.

I think this piece of news is interesting as it marks another step towards a **new kind of web** as both users and platform owners realize the damaging aspects of social media and the Internet at large. I believe, however, that a lot of teens will simply stop using Instagram and move towards Telegram, Signal or another less controlled platform to escape this new level of "surveialnce."
